This Privacy Policy (or the “Policy”) applies to its websites (whether currently or in the future supported, hosted or maintained, including without limitation nodejs.org, the “Sites”) and describes the information the Foundation collects about users of the Sites (“users”) and how that information may be used.</p>
<p>Read the Privacy Policy carefully. By using any Site, you will be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Policy. If you do not agree to accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, you are directed to discontinue accessing or otherwise using the Sites or any materials obtained from the Sites.</p>

Each time a user uses the Sites, the current version of the Privacy Policy applies. Accordingly, a user should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the top) and review for any changes since the last version. If a user does not agree to the Privacy Policy, the user should not use any of the Sites. Continued use any of the Sites following any revision of this Privacy Policy constitutes an acceptance of any change.</p>
<h2 id="header-what-does-this-privacy-policy-cover">What Does this Privacy Policy Cover?<a name="what-does-this-privacy-policy-cover" class="anchor" href="#what-does-this-privacy-policy-cover" aria-labelledby="header-what-does-this-privacy-policy-cover"></a></h2><p>This Privacy Policy covers the Foundation’s treatment of aggregate information collected by the Sites and personal information that you provide in connection with your use of the Sites.

If you are under 18, you may use the Site only with involvement of a parent or guardian or if you are an emancipated minor.

<ul>
<li>To understand a user’s needs and create content that is relevant to the user;</li>
<li>To generate statistical studies;</li>
<li>To conduct market research and planning by sending user surveys;</li>
<li>To notify user referrals of services, information, or products when a user requests that the Foundation send such information to referrals;</li>

</ul>
<p>User names, identifications ("IDs"), and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on a Site when users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information, such as when a user posts information in conjunction with content subject to an Open Source license, or as part of a message posted to a public forum or a publicly released software application. The personal information you may provide to the Foundation may reveal or allow others to discern aspects of your life that are not expressly stated in your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your hair color, race or approximate age). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile or post a photograph, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting our Terms of Use and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying information to us, including any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You may withdraw your consent to the Foundation’s collection and processing of your information by closing your account.  You should be aware that your information may continue to be viewable to others after you close your account, such as on cached pages on Internet search engines.  Users may not be able to change or remove public postings once posted. Such information may be used by visitors of these pages to send unsolicited messages. The Foundation is not responsible for any consequences which may occur from the third-party use of information that a user chooses to submit to public pages.</p>
<h2 id="header-opt-out">Opt Out<a name="opt-out" class="anchor" href="#opt-out" aria-labelledby="header-opt-out"></a></h2><p>A user will always be able to make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information including personally identifiable information. If a user does not provide requested information, the user may not be able to complete certain transactions.</p>
<p>Users are not licensed to add other users to a Site (even users who entered into transactions with them) or to their mailing lists without written consent.
The Foundation encourages users to evaluate privacy and security policies of any of the Sites’ transaction partners before entering into transactions or choosing to disclose information.</p>
<h2 id="header-email">Email<a name="email" class="anchor" href="#email" aria-labelledby="header-email"></a></h2><p>The Foundation may use (or provide to The Linux Foundation or other third party contractors to use) contact information received by the Foundation to email any user with respect to any Foundation or project of The Linux Foundation (a “Project”) opportunity, event or other matter.</p>
<p>If a user no longer wishes to receive emails from the Foundation or any Project or any Site, the Foundation will (or, if applicable, have The Linux Foundation) provide instructions in each of its emails on how to be removed from any lists. The Foundation will make commercially reasonable efforts to honor such requests.</p>
<h2 id="header-photographs">Photographs<a name="photographs" class="anchor" href="#photographs" aria-labelledby="header-photographs"></a></h2><p>Users may have the opportunity to submit photographs to the Sites for product promotions, contests, and other purposes to be disclosed at the time of request. In these circumstances, the Sites are designed to allow the public to view, download, save, and otherwise access the photographs posted. By submitting a photograph, users waive any privacy expectations users have with respect to the security of such photographs, and the Foundation’s use or exploitation of users’ likeness.  You may submit a photograph only if you are the copyright holder or if you are authorized to do so under license by the copyright holder, and by submitting a photograph you agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, its directors, officers, employees and agents harmless from any claims arising out of your submission.

When a user uses these links, the user leaves the Sites. The Foundation has not reviewed these third party sites, does not control, and is not responsible for, any of the third party sites, their content or privacy practices. The privacy and security practices of websites accessed from the Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and the Foundation is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites, including but not limited to the third party services you access through the Foundation. If a user decides to access any of the linked sites, the Foundation encourages the user to read the privacy statements of those sites. The user accesses such sites at user’s own risk.</p>
<p>We may receive information when you use your account to log into a third-party site or application in order to recommend tailored content or advertising to you and to improve your user experience on our site. We may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to third parties to measure Internet traffic and usage patterns.</p>

The Foundation is not responsible for the services provided or information collected on such third party sites.</p>
<h2 id="header-sharing-of-information">Sharing of Information<a name="sharing-of-information" class="anchor" href="#sharing-of-information" aria-labelledby="header-sharing-of-information"></a></h2><p>The Foundation may disclose personal or aggregate information that is associated with your profile as described in this Privacy Policy, as permitted by law or as reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) investigate and enforce this Privacy Policy or our then-current Terms of Use, if any; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of the Foundation, our users, or the public; or (6) as part of the sale of all or a portion of the assets of the Foundation or as a change in control of the organization or one of its affiliates or in preparation for any of these events.  The Foundation reserves the right to supply any such information to any organization into which the Foundation may merge in the future or to which it may make any transfer.  Any third party to which the Foundation transfers or sells all or any of its assets will have the right to use the personal and other information that you provide in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.  </p>
<h2 id="header-is-information-about-me-secure">Is Information About Me Secure?<a name="is-information-about-me-secure" class="anchor" href="#is-information-about-me-secure" aria-labelledby="header-is-information-about-me-secure"></a></h2><p>To keep your information safe, prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, the Foundation implements industry-standard physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information the Foundation collects. However, the Foundation does not guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never defeat measures taken to prevent improper use of personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Access to users’ nonpublic personally identifiable information is restricted to the Foundation and Linux Foundation personnel, including contractors for each such organization on a need-to-know basis.</p>
<p>User passwords are keys to accounts. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters for passwords and do not disclose passwords to other people in order to prevent loss of account control. Users are responsible for all actions taken in their accounts. Notify the Foundation of any password compromises, and change passwords periodically to maintain account protection.</p>
<p>In the event the Foundation becomes aware that the security of a Site has been compromised or user’s personally identifiable information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to security attacks or fraud, the Foundation reserves the right to take reasonable appropriate measures, including but not limited to, investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.</p>
<p>While our aim is to keep data from unauthorized or unsafe access, modification or destruction, no method of transmission on the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<h2 id="header-data-protection">Data Protection<a name="data-protection" class="anchor" href="#data-protection" aria-labelledby="header-data-protection"></a></h2><p>Given the international scope of the Foundation, personal information may be visible to persons outside your country of residence, including to persons in countries that your own country’s privacy laws and regulations deem deficient in ensuring an adequate level of protection for such information.  If you are unsure whether this privacy statement is in conflict with applicable local rules, you should not submit your information.  If you are located within the European Union, you should note that your information will be transferred to the United States, which is deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data protection.  Nevertheless, in accordance with local laws implementing the European Union Privacy Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, individuals located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to its transfer to and/or storage in the United States of America. By utilizing any Site and/or directly providing personal information to us, you hereby agree to and acknowledge your understanding of the terms of this Privacy Policy, and consent to have your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States and/or in other jurisdictions as determined by the Foundation, notwithstanding your country of origin, or country, state and/or province of residence.  If you do not want your personal information collected and used by the Foundation, please do not visit or use the Sites.</p>
<h2 id="header-governing-law">Governing Law<a name="governing-law" class="anchor" href="#governing-law" aria-labelledby="header-governing-law"></a></h2><p>This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of California, United States of America without giving any effect to the principles of conflicts of law.</p>
<h2 id="header-california-privacy-rights">California Privacy Rights<a name="california-privacy-rights" class="anchor" href="#california-privacy-rights" aria-labelledby="header-california-privacy-rights"></a></h2><p>The California Online Privacy Protection Action (“CalOPPA”) permits customers who are California residents and who have provided the Foundation with “personal information” as defined in CalOPPA to request certain information about the disclosure of information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident with a question regarding this provision, please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3646445f4057554f76585952535c4518594451"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a1d1d3c8d7c0c2d8e1cfcec5c4cbd28fced3c6">[email protected]</span></a>.</p>
<p>Please note that the Foundation does not respond to “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms intended to allow California residents to opt-out of Internet tracking under CalOPPA.  The Foundation may track and/or disclose your online activities over time and across different websites to third parties when you use our services.</p>
